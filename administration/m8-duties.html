I worked on test generation. To see this run, click on the &#8216;Create
Test&#8217; button that is on the navigation bar. When the GUI pops up, enter
some values and press the 'Next&#8217;' button. The values for &#8216;Test Name&#8217;,
&#8216;Start Date&#8217;, and &#8216;End Date&#8217; are inserted into the database. These
operations appear in stdout.<br>

I worked on the question table view of the question bank and the
question response validation. The question table screen can be accessed
by clicking the view questions button from the main toolbar. If you
click the &#8220;New Question&#8221; button in the lower left hand corner, we
currently hardcode in values for a new question and insert it only into
the view; we have yet to insert the question into a database. All of
the button clicks on this screen are logged in the controller, and the
fake database insertion operations are logged at the dao level.<br>

I worked on login and user authentication. This is the first screen you
see when you open up the app. On the login page, enter a username and
password. You will notice that if you are not registered, you will not
be able to login to the app. Click the new user hyperlink to open the
registration screen to register for the app. Once you fill in your
information, click the register button and you will be taken back to
the login page, where you can now login to the app. <br>

I worked on test presentation. To see this run, click the "View Tests" button on the navigation bar. When the GUI pops up, select an existing test and click "View Test" to see the test's data. This shows a paginated list of the test questions, formatted as the student can expect to see them.<br>
