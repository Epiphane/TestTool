Functional Requirements
</h3>
<ul>
<p>
<li>

<strong>General organization</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<a name="presentation-guidelines">
For the next milestone deliverable, be sure that all scenarios follow the
presentation guidelines we've discussed in class.  You still have some work to do in this area.  Here are the guidelines again:
</a>
<ul>
<li>
Use present tense, active voice, third person; in particular no "will", "can",
"could", "should", "we", "you"; e.g., instead of "When the user opens the Test
Tool for the first time, figure 1 gets shown" say "When the user opens the Test
Tool for the first time, the program displays the interface shown in Figure 1"
<li>
Follow the action/response use case conventions:
<ul>
<li>
describe user action, <em>before</em> the figure that illustrates it
<li>
describe software response thoroughly, which is a screen and/or other
computation
<li>
explain response, including screen contents
<li>
provide number and caption for all figures, and refer to figures by number in
the narrative.
</ul>
<li>
Use consistent terminology throughout.
<li>
Use definitely language, in particular don't use "such as", but rather say
"that are" or the contextually appropriate definite language.
</ul>

</ul>

<p>
<li>
<strong>Section 2.1</strong>
<ul>
<li>
This section should have initial empty UIs for instructor and student.
<p><li>
The later sections you refer to are where the filled-in UIs go.
<li>
<strong>Action Items:</strong>
<p> <li>
<em>Show initial empty UIs for each type of user.</em>
<a href="../requirements/ui-overview.html">
<strong>Response.</strong>
</a>
<p>
<li>
<strong>Score:80/100</strong>

</ul>


<p>
<li>
<strong>Section 2.2</strong>
<ul>
<li>
  You need to show non-generic content for test names, instead of "Test 1" etc.

<p><li>
You also need a step-by-step presentation of tests being created, or an explantion of where tests like you show in Figure 2 come from.

<p><li>
At this point, you have test creation and editing content spread across too many sectons.  I suggst merging all of 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and 2.8 into 2.2.

<p><li>
    You have a good chunk of work to do to show all test generation detais; as noted in the m2-eval and previous discussions, I'm looking for some form of automated generation that allows the user to enter basic test parameters and have the tool generate a test.  The parameters I have in mind are class, time, number of questions, and overall difficulty.

<p><li>

<strong>Action Items:</strong>

<em>After merging contenet, show concrete scenarios of automated test create and editing.</em>

<strong>Section 2.5</strong>
<ul>
<li>
You have some significant work to do here, as itemized in the action items.
<li>
<strong>Action Items:</strong>
<ol type=1>

<p> <li>
<em>Start with an empty question bank and show each different type of questionbeing added.</em>

<em>Use realistic test question content, such as the examples in the 307 site.</em>

<p> <li>
<em>Coordinate question content between sections 2.2 and 2.5, so that the questions on the generated test are the same as in the question bank.</em>

<strong>Response.</strong>

<p> <li>

<li>
<strong>Score:</strong>

</ul>

<p>
<li>
<strong>Section 2.6</strong>
<ul>
<p><li>
You should flip the order of 2.6 and 2.7, so taking comes before grading.

<li>
  In conjunction with the previous sections, show the same test being graded as was taken.
  
<p><li>
At one point you "Teachers are required to mark each question as correct or incorrect."  This should not be the case.  Rather, there should be some simple test graing rules for each type of question the that TestTool automatically applies to a test.

<p><li>
After autograding, the instructor reviews the test, changes scores if necessary, and adds comments as necessary.


<li>
<strong>Action Items:</strong>
<ol type=1>
<p> <li>
<em>Address the test grading functionality discussed in the m2-eval, and outlined in the preceding remarks</em>

<h3>
Specification
</h3>
<ul>
<p>
<li>
<strong>General remarks</strong>
<ul>
<li>
I think you should take another pass at the packaging, so that it's more traceable to the spec.

<p><li>
admin, test,and question are reasonable packages

<p><li>
packages automation and monopoly don't make much sense

<p><li>
I suggest adding grading and taking packages, and renaming "testmaking" to the subpackage test/create

</ul>

<p>
<li>
<strong>admin Package</strong>
<ul>
This is a good M4 draft
<li>

<li>
<strong>Score: </strong> 100/100

</ul>

<p>
<li>
<strong>automation Package</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Rename to grader package.
<li>
Add methods for grading each type of question and adding instructor feedback. 
<li>
<strong>Score: </strong> 75/100

</ul>

<p>
<li>
<strong>monopoly Package</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Make this just the overall root package.
<li>
<strong>Score: </strong> N.A 

</ul>

<p>
<li>
<strong>question Package</strong>
<ul>
<li>
You need to refine the data rep for each question to model its content, in particular its answer

I also don't see a QuestionBank collection class
<li>
<strong>Score: </strong> 70/100

</ul>

<p>
<li>
<strong>test Package</strong>
<ul>
<li>
This is a good m4 draft.
<li>
You need to refine the model so that it different types of tests have different types of question content.
<li>
<strong>Score: </strong> 90/100

</ul>

<p>
<li>
<strong>testtaking Package</strong>
<ul>
<li>
This is a good m4 draft
<li>
In conjunction with the other packages, you need to model how the student answer to a question is associated with a taken test.  
<li>
<strong>Score: </strong> 95/100
</ul>

Work Focus for Milestone 6
</h3>
<p>
<strong><em><font color=red>TA Grading Note -- Adjust the tasks in the table as
necessary for the teams, based on what they've worked on so far.  The important
thing is to have each team member working on a specific part of the project for
Milestone 6.</font></em></strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The following table has the areas to focus on for the implementation and formal
specification parts of Milestone 6.
<p>
<li>
The assignment of team members to tasks is up to you.
<p>
<li>
We'll discuss in our lab meeting during week 6 and adjust tasks as necessary.
