Functional Requirements

<ul>
<p>
</p><li>
<strong>General organization</strong>
<ul>
<li>
General organization is good for this milestone. You might want to
consider incorporating some of the sections/features into your
requirements that are listed below.
</li><li>Make sure all sections have the correct title. Also,
top-level section pages should contain a general description of the
section and links to all sub-sections. (2.3 is done correctly, 2.5 is
not)

Use this as a guide to help organize your requirements, not as an absolutely
required reorganization:

</li></ul>

ALL SECTIONS: 
<p></p></li><li>Be sure to: use present tense, active voice, third person... in particular, <strong> no "will", "can", "could", "should", "we", "you", etc. </strong>

</li><li>
Bad: The filled-in multiple choice form will show the answers that have been entered.
</li><li>
Good: TestTool displays the answers that have been entered in the filled-in multiple choice form.
<p>
</p></li><li>
<strong>Section 2.1</strong>
<ul>
<li>
This looks pretty good for this milestone.

<p>
</p></li><li>
<strong>Action Items:</strong>
<ol type="1">
	<p> </p><li>
	When you reference other sections of the requirements, include a link to the appropriate section.

	<strong>Response.</strong>
	</a>

	<p> </p></li><li>
	Add a common login screen that all users see on launch.

<strong>Score: 90</strong> /100

</li></ul>

<p>
</p></li><li>
<strong>Section 2.2</strong>
<ul>
<li>You already explained the landing screen, so this section should
begin with Figure 2. You just need to state "The tests menu screen is
displayed when the user selects Tests from the landing screen"
</li><li>
This scenario only has one relevant UI screen.


<p>

<strong>Action Items:</strong>

	<p> </p></li><li>
2.3 shows how the user can schedule a test to be automatically
published during creation. You will need to show how the user can
modify or disable that after the test has been created. <a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/%7Egfisher/classes/307/admin/response-stub.html">

<strong>Score: 80</strong> /100

</li></ul>

<p>
</p></li><li>
<strong>Section 2.3</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Refer to notes above on tense and active voice.
</li><li>
In general, you want to explain and list components of UI screens under their figure.
</li><li>
I think 'Question Creation' would probably fit better under 'Question
Bank'. The general flow of TestTool is: create a course, add questions
to that course, generate a test (based on paramaters like average
difficulty, total duration, # of questions, etc.) for a specific
course. You can in fact create a question for a test, but it will use
the same question creation UI that's used for the full Question bank.
The user can have the option to create a "one off" question just for a
test, without having that question persist in the question bank
</li><li>As we've discussed in some of our meetings, I'd like to have
a more automated form of test generation, that does not require the
user to individually select questions.
<ul>

</ul>

<p>
</p></li><li>
<strong>Action Items:</strong>
<ol type="1">
	<p> </p><li> Explain the details of generating a test.
Have some distinction between the idea of basic and advanced
generation. Allow the user to make 'last minute changes' to a generated
test before finalizing. <a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/%7Egfisher/classes/307/admin/response-stub.html">
	<strong>Response.</strong>

	<strong>Response.</strong>
	</a>


	<p> </p></li><li>
	You will need to show the user making changes to the various types of questions. (show before and after)

<p>
</p></li><li>
<strong>Section 2.4</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Good work for this milestone.
</li><li>
You should reference relevant sections in the intro. 
</li><li>
"The Editing Tests window is displayed when the user creates a test
(see section 2.3.1) or edits an existing test (see section 2.3.2)"
....and provide links to those sections
</li><li>I'd like to see a tabluar for of test editing UI that allows
the instructor to view a generated test, with each row being a question
and each column being a question attribute. This is an editable view of
the test that's not in its directlly takeable for as you show in Figure
1 of Section 2.4.
<p>
</p></li><li>
<strong>Action Items:</strong>
<ol type="1">
	<p> </p><li>
	Show the user re-ordering questions
	<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/%7Egfisher/classes/307/admin/response-stub.html">

	<p> </p></li><li>
	You describe an option to add or create questions, but that isn't shown in the UI.

<p>
</p></li><li>
<strong>Section 2.5</strong>
<ul>
<li>
I'd like to see the same kind of tabluar UI to edit the full question bank as I described above for editing a test.  This means
there will be some joint refinement for Sections 2.4 and 2.5.
<ul>
<li>
The comments in Section 2.4 about having column headings for all question
attributes apply here to the question bank tabular editor.
</li><li>
Also, the table view in the test editor can have the same general
organization and layout details as the table view for the question bank.
</li><li>The main difference between the test editing table view and
the question bank table view are in the operations that are available.
</li><li>
The other difference is that the test editing table can have a couple addtional
column headings for each question -- (1) an explicit question number on the
teset; (2) the number of points the question is worth on the test.  Neither of
these attributes applies to questions in the question bank.
</li></ul>

</li><li>I like the idea of increasing specificity, but what if I want
to see all the questions for CPE 307? I think you should support this
option.
</li><li>
Title is incorrect for this section. You are also missing the top-level section page (see 2.3 for example)
</li><li>
As I mentioned above, I think adding new questions would best fit in this section.

<p>
</p></li><li>
<strong>Action Items:</strong>
<ol type="1">
	<p> </p><li>
	Allow the user to view all questions for a specific subject. (This is what a question bank really is)
	<a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/%7Egfisher/classes/307/admin/response-stub.html">
	<strong>Response.</strong>

</li></ul>

<p>
</p></li><li>
<strong>Section 2.6</strong>
<ul>
<li>
I envison more functionality for instructor test grading than what you have:
<ul>
<li>
I'd like a screen that lists all the auto-graded tests and allows the
instructor to zoom in on the detail of any individual test.
</li><li>
We need an auto-grading rule for <em>every</em> of question,
so that the instructor does not manually mark each question, but rather
confirms that the auto-grade result is correct.
</li><li>The instrucor needs a way to add comments to any graded
question, and a convenient way to place the same comment on multiple
tests.
</li><li>I envision two ways to view graded tests. One view is
student-by-student, where the instructor views the full test for each
studetn. The other view is question-by-question, where the instructor
can view the same question accross all students. This second view
allows for easier consistent grading of one particular question.
</li></ul>

</li><li>
Top-level link is not working
</li><li>
See above notes on how to structure intro, tense, and active voice.
</li><li>
Think about color coding tests based on grade and/or completeness.

<p>
</p></li><li>
<strong>Action Items:</strong>
<ol type="1">
	<p> </p><li>
	Show the high-level grading UIs described in the remarks.

	<p> </p></li><li>
	Add auto-grading for all types of questions.  Show the instructor changing auto-graded results in a couple use cases.

<strong>Section 2.7</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Good work for this milestone.
</li><li>
See above notes on tense, active voice, third person, etc. 
</li><li>
To refine for the next milestone, you need to show each different type of question being answered.

<p>
</p></li><li>
<strong>Action Items:</strong>
<ol type="1">
	<p> </p><li>
	Show each type of question being answered.

	<strong>Response.</strong>
	</a>

	<p> </p></li><li>
Add a question list. It'd probably fit best on the sidebar. This will
allow the user to navigate directly to a specific question (useful on
large tests). Also, you can indicate question progress by color-coding
the question list. Red = not started, Yellow = started, but not
confirmed, Green = confirmed. We can discuss this in class. <a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/%7Egfisher/classes/307/admin/response-stub.html">
	<strong>Response.</strong>
	</a>

	<p> </p></li><li>
Show the different scenarios you discuss: "suggest using extra time for
review". Also, show what happens when you click 'turn it in'. If it's
all multiple choice, do you get a grade automatically? <a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/%7Egfisher/classes/307/admin/response-stub.html">
