####Java Style Guide
*3 space indentation. Spaces, not tabs.
*Curly braces go on the same line as the statement:
** <tt>public void methodName(int param) { </tt>
*Ending curly braces should be vertically aligned with the beginning of the declaration with the opening brace.
*No space between methodName and opening parentheses for parameters.
*Spaces after keywords like <tt>for</tt>, <tt>if</tt>, and <tt>while</tt>
*<tt>else</tt> should be on the same line as the closing brace of the preceding <tt>if</tt>
*Method names should be camelCased. Class names should be UpperCamelCased.
*If your method or name could be confusing, rethink it. 
**If you can't make it specific and easy to understand, leave a comment with its purpose.
