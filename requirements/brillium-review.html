<p>
Brillium is a web based test and survey creation tool. It provides a complete product for test creation, modifying, and analyzing. Because it is a web based platform, all tests and questions created are saved remotely, reducing the amount of local space needed as well as the chance of losing created materials.  Brillium includes nearly all features outlined in this requirement, but noticeably does not include any sort of automated grading.
<p>
Overall Brillium is a good tool for creating tests and analyzing the results of them, but comes with a big price tag, with monthly pricing options starting at $49 a month for the personal option.
