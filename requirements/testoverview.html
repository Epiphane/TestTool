         After the instructor logs in and selected the Tests button, the tests overview screen shown in Figure 1 is displayed.

         This screen shows what the tests overview page will look like before any tests have been created. The instructor clicks either "Create Test" button on the page to create a new test. 

         After the instructor creates a few tests, the tests overview page will change to look like the screen seen in Figure 2.

      Here the TestTool presents the instructor with all of the options available to them associated with tests. On the top menu bar, the Create Test button takes the instructor to the test creation menu, found in <a href="test-creation-scenario.html">section 2.2.1.</a> In the top menu bar is also a search field, which the instructor uses to search for any tests they have already created by name. 
      </p>

      <p>
      The Edit button brings the instructor to the test edit screen for the selected test. Discussion of this part of the application can be found in <a href="edit-tests.html">section 2.2.3</a> The instructor will use the edit button to change the most recent versions of the test, allowing them to change or add questions and save new versions.
      </p>

      <p>
      The Publish button allows the instructor to publish the test for taking and viewing by students. A dialog (to be created) will allow the instructor to decide how this test should be published including the options to let students, view all questions, only view questions after taking the test, or only allow them to view that the test is published and ready to be taken. The general permissions of the test is indicated by the Public? shader, where a red box indicates that the test is not public, a green box indicating the test is fully public, and a yellow box indicating the test has limited permissions.
      </p>

      <p>
      The Grade button allows the instructor to grade an already completed test. After the test has been taken by all students, the instructor is able to view the automated results from the grader, as well as view all answers made by students to each question. The grading screen will be discussed further in <a href="grade-test.html">section 2.5.</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      The View button will take the instructor to a screen where they can view a test and information about that test. This screen will closely resemble how a student will see a test while taking it, but will include additional information such as question count, last time given, and number of versions amongst others. This screen will be discussed further in <a href="view-test.html">section 2.2.2</a>
