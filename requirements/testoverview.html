      Here the user is presented with all of the options available to them associated with tests. On the top menu bar, the Create Test button will take the user to the test creation menu, found in section 2.3. In the top menu bar is also a search field, allowing the user to search for any tests they have already created by name. 
      </p>

      <p>
      The Edit button allows the user to edit an already created test. Discussion of this part of the application can be found in section 2.4. The user will use the edit button to change the most recent versions of the test, allowing them to change or add questions and save new versions.
      </p>

      <p>
      The Publish button allows the user to publish the test for taking and viewing by students. A dialog (to be created) will allow the user to decide how this test should be published including the options to let students, view all questions, only view questions after taking the test, or only allow them to view that the test is published and ready to be taken. The general permissions of the test is indicated by the Public? shader, where a red box indicates that the test is not public, a green box indicating the test is fully public, and a yellow box indicating the test has limited permissions.
      </p>

      <p>
      The Grade button allows the user to grade an already completed test. After the test has been taken by all students, the user is able to view the automated results from the grader, as well as view all answers made by students to each question. The grading screen will be discussed further in section 2.6.
      </p>

      <p>
      The View button will take the user to a screen where they can view a test and information about that test. This screen will closely resemble how a student will see a test while taking it, but will include additional information such as question count, last time given, and number of versions amongst others. This screen will be discussed further in section 2.3
