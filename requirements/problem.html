1.1.  Problem Statement
</h3>
</a>
<p>
The general problems to be addressed by Test Tool are the following:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
the need for a reliable and easy to use software tool that quickly generates tests
<p> <li>
the need for a secure tool that administers a test
</ol>
While these problems have been solved by a number of commercially available and public domain products, the Test Tool provides a solution with certain functional improvements over existing tools. Specific problem areas are the following:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
to provide a convenient way to reuse test questions
<p> <li>
to allow the administration of a test in varying modes and environments
</ol>
<p>
The Test Tool project addresses the requirements of a particular customer. This customer needs a tool with a collection of features not available in any single existing tool. This aspect of the problem is one of combining a set of existing features in a way that the features have yet to be combined in another product.
<p>
In addition, the development of functioning software, the Test Tool project focuses on two additional problems not addressed in commercial tools:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
to provide a pedagogical example for use in the instruction of software engineering, including an example of the practical application of formal methods
<p> <li>
to provide fully documented, public domain source code for use by others
</ol>
