      <p>
      When an instructor selects the "Edit" button from the test overview page or the test view page, the screen in Figure 1 is shown.

      <p>
      The test edit screen has an input field at the top for the test name, as well as an option to save the test.
      This save option is also at the bottom of the page as well, for convenience.
      </p>
      <p>
      The main portion of the screen is a list of all the questions in order. Each question has the relevant
      question, answer options, etc presented in a customizable (for custom question types) format.
      The top right section of each card has 4 options: 2 arrows to reorganize questions (either by drag and drop
      or by moving one at a time), an edit button to edit the question, and a button to remove the question.
      Upon clicking delete, the page will confirm that you want to delete that question.
      </p>
      <p>
      The edit button will send the user to the <a href="question-editing.html">question editing page</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      At the bottom of the page is also an option to add or create questions from the <a href="question-bank.html">Question Bank</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Figures 2, 3, and 4 show possible question types.
