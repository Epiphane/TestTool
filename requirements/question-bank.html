      When the instructor navigates to the question bank, he/she is presented
      with the screen in Figure 1.

      The list of questions saved in the question bank is presented in a table
      view providing a brief overview of all the questions available. The
      instructor has the option of clicking a question to open it in the 
      <a href="question-editing.html">Question Editing</a> screen, or selecting
      one or more questions and clicking the "Make Test" button to create a new
      test and open the <a href="new-test-options.html">New Test Options</a>
      screen. If the raw list of questions is too overwhelming, the instructor can
      click the "Question Search" button in the lower left to open the screen shown
      in Figure 2.

      Once in the search screen, the instructor can return to the table of
      questions by clicking the "Question Table" button in the lower left.
      The search question screen is organized into three tabs of increasing specificity.
      The screen is initially opened to the subjects tab, where the instructor
      can search or scroll for a subject. The screen also supports sorting the
      listed items by either item name, item creation date, or item
      modification date, as shown in Figure 3.

      Once the instructor clicks a subject,
      the test tab will be focused and tests belonging to the selected subject
      will be shown, and the subject name will be populated in the search bar.
      The instructor can also select the test tab manually, or clear out the
      search bar and click search to view all tests, as shown in Figure 4.

      Once again, the instructor can search or scroll for a test, and selecting
      a test will open the questions tab with the selected test name prefilled
      in the search bar, shown in Figure 5. Clearing the search bar and
      clicking search will remove the subject/test filter for the questions and
      will list all questions. The instructor once again can manually select
      the question tab to view all questions unfiltered.

      The instructor again has the option of selecting one or more checkboxes next 
      to the questions to create a list of selected questions. Then, the
      instructor can click the "Make Test" button to create a new test using
      the selected questions. This button will take the instructor to the 
      <a href="new-test-options.html">New Test Options</a> screen. Clicking an
      individual question will open the <a href="question-editing.html">
        Question Editing</a> screen. Additionally, the instructor can use the
      question tab to search for all questions for a subject or a particular test
      using the search bar and appropriate keywords as shown in Figure 6.
