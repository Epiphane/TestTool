      When the instructor navigates to the question bank, he/she is presented
      with the screen in Figure 1.

      The question bank screen is organized into three tabs of increasing specificity.
      The screen is initially opened to the subjects tab, where the instructor
      can search or scroll for a subject. Once the instructor clicks a subject,
      the test tab will be focused and tests belonging to the selected subject
      will be shown, and the subject name will be populated in the search bar.
      The instructor can also select the test tab manually, or clear out the
      search bar and click search to view all tests, as shown in Figure 2. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Once again, the instructor can search or scroll for a test, and selecting
      a test will open the questions tab with the selected test name prefilled
      in the search bar, shown in Figure 3. Clearing the search bar and
      clicking search will remove the subject/test filter for the questions and
      will list all questions. The instructor once again can manually select
      the question tab to view all questions unfiltered.
      </p>

      <p>
      The instructor has the option of selecting one or more checkboxes next to the questions to create a list of selected questions. Then, the instructor can click the "Make Test" button to create a new test using the selected questions. This button will take the instructor to the <a href="new-test-options.html">New Test Options</a> screen. Clicking an individual question will open the <a href="question-editing.html">Question Editing</a> screen.
