    Test Tool gives focus to the text input. The teacher types "What is Gene Fisher's favorite color". Then the teacher "Enter question A" causing Test Tool to give that text input focus. The Teacher types "Blue", and hits enter. The text input for question B gains focus. The teacher procedes to enter "Green", "Red", and "Yellow" for the next options. The teacher clicks the check box next to "Blue" to indicate that it is the correct answer. Test Tool darkens that check box to show that the click went through.

    <p>
      The filled-in multiple choice form will show the answers that have been entered. The green button on the left side marks an answer as correct, and only one answer can be marked correct. The current correct answer's button is darkened. Answers may be added or removed, down to a minimum of 2. The Teacher clicks "Finish" to return to the <a href="./question-bank.html"> question bank </a>.

<p>

<p>
   If the user selects code from the dropdown, the question form changes as seen in Figure 4.
  The code question form has a prompt similar to the long-answer form. It also has a text input to show any formatted code that may be required for the test question (for example, a Java class or enum for a CPE 102 exam). 
  It also includes a disabled text field similar to the long-answer form, and a button to upload a grading script (for which the UI is not yet defined).

<p>
  If the user selects matching from the dropdown, the question form changes as seen in Figure 5.
  Each element in the left column corresponds to the same line in the right column. Both columns have editable fields, similar to the multiple-choice options.
  On the test taking view, the options will be randomized. 
</p>

<p>
   Once the user has filled out their desired question form, the user clicks "Finish" and is returned to whichever view brought them to the Create Questions form (Test Bank or Edit Test).
