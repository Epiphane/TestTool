      <p>
         The Test Tool application is broken up into three main sections: Tests (<a href="testoverview.html">Section 2.2</a>), Questions (<a href="question-bank.html">Section 2.3</a>), taking tests <a href="take-tests.html">(Section 2.4)</a> , and grading tests (<a href="student-test-list-view.html">Section 2.5</a>)
         Screens under the Tests catagory involve creating, viewing, and editing Tests. This is the biggest part of the app.
         Screens under the Questions catagory involve creating, viewing, and editing questions. They also include the overall Question Bank available for use to the instructor in all tests.
         Screens under taking tests involve the views students see when they take a test, and screens under grading tests involve the views instructors will see when grading tests.

      The "Tests" button takes the instructor to a list of his or her already created tests. From there, the instructor is able to edit, create, publish, or grade his or her tests <a href="testoverview.html">(Section 2.2)</a>.  The Questions button takes the instructor to the question bank, where he or she is able to view, edit and create questions to be used within their tests. The "Give Test" button will take the instructor to a proctoring screen, where he or she can administer the test while students take it. Finally, the Take Test button takes the instructor to a student view, and allows the instructor to take tests as if her or she were a student.

       Figure 3 is a simplified version of the instructor landing page, having only a view grades and take test button. The View Grades button takes the student to a page showing their grades of tests they are already taken. The Take Test button brings the student to a page to take any available tests to them.
