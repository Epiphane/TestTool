      From here the user can navigate into the application where they wish to go.

      The Tests button will take the user to a list of their already created tests. From there the user can then edit, create, publish, or grade their tests (Section 2.2).  The Questions button will take the user to the question bank, where they can view, edit and create questions to be used within their tests. The Give Test button will take the user to a proctoring screen, where they can control the test as it is being taken by students. Finally the Take Test button will take the user to a student view, and allow them take tests that they have already created. This view can be found in Figure 2.

      This figure shows the landing screen students see when they open the app. It is a simplified version of the instructor landing page, having only a view grades and take test button. The View Grades button takes the student to a page showing their grades of tests they are already taken. The Take Test button brings the student to a page to take any available tests to them.
