         </h3>
      </span>

      <p>
         The Test Tool application is broken up into three main sections: Tests (<a href="testoverview.html">Section 2.2</a>), Questions (<a href="question-bank.html">Section 2.3</a>), taking tests <a href="take-tests.html">(Section 2.4)</a> , and grading tests (<a href="student-test-list-view.html">Section 2.5</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
         Screens under the Tests catagory involve creating, viewing, and editing Tests. This is the biggest part of the app.
      </p>

      <p>
         Screens under the Questions catagory involve creating, viewing, and editing questions. They also include the overall Question Bank available for use to the instructor in all tests.
      </p>

      <p>
         Screens under taking tests involve the views students see when they take a test, and screens under grading tests involve the views instructors will see when grading tests.

      <p>
         Here the user will enter their login information in order to enter the app.

      <p>
      From here the user can navigate into the application where they wish to go.
      </p>

      <p>
      The Tests button takes the user to a list of their already created tests. From there the user is able to edit, create, publish, or grade their tests <a href="testoverview.html">(Section 2.2)</a>.  The Questions button takes the user to the question bank, where they are able to view, edit and create questions to be used within their tests. The Give Test button will take the user to a proctoring screen, where they can control the test as it is being taken by students. Finally the Take Test button takes the user to a student view, and allows them to take tests that they have already created.

      <p>
       Figure 3 is a simplified version of the instructor landing page, having only a view grades and take test button. The View Grades button takes the student to a page showing their grades of tests they are already taken. The Take Test button brings the student to a page to take any available tests to them.
