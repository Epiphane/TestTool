      </span>

      <p>
      The student opens Test Tool, <a href="./ui-overview.html"> logs in</a> then clicks on "Take Tests" and is presented with the screen in Figure 1.

         This screen shows the student the tests that are available to be taken. The student clicks on a test and is taken to the Pre-test screen to confirm his/her intent to take the test.

      The initial display confirms intent to take the test. It displays
      information such as question count, deadline, and time restriction on the test.
      There is an option to confirm the student's intent before taking the test, or
      decline to take the test and start it later.
      </p>
      <p>
      Figures 2 and 3 show the test pages once testing has begun.

      The test screen has a header bar which displays the test name, question count,
      and a progress bar. In addition, it has a live counter showing how long is left
      before the test is over, which turns red when the test time is nearly up.
      </p>

      <p>
      On the page, questions are shown as cards in order, and paginated so that the UI
      is not much taller than a page at any given time.
      </p>

      <p>
      Depending on the type of question, the card will have different formats for presenting
      the problem and possible answers. This can be modified for custom question types
      but defaults to the short answer type, with a question and text box for solution.
      </p>

      <p>
      For the 307 Midterm, the student sees peach boxes sorrunding each question.
      After some time passes, the Student sees that he or she has less time left. The student continues to click next as he or she answers questions.
      </p>

      <p>
      Figure 4 shows the screen once a student navigates to the end of a test.
      </p>

      <p>
      The final screen confirms that the test is over, and presents any possible concerns such as:
      </p>

      <ul>
         <li>Unanswered questions</li>
         <li>Suggest using extra time for review</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      Upon confirming that the student is done test-taking, it will take the student back to
      their dashboard and turn in the test. Test Tool has noticed that the student did not answer one of the questions, and notifies the student.
