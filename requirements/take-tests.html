      When the user initially invokes the Calendar tool, the screen appears as shown
      in Figure 1.

      <hr>
      </a>
      <br>

The initial display consists of two windows: a standard form of pulldown
command menu and a display of the current monthly calendar.  The calendar entry
for the current date is highlighted with a widened border.  The monthly display
is the standard default view.  The user may change this and other default
settings using the option commands discussed later.
<p>
Figure 2 shows an expansion of the command menus.

<em>Editorial Remark: Some 308 tools may have more than one primary initial UI,
for different categories of user.  E.g., there may be one initial UI for
student users and another for instructors.  If more that one top-level UIs is
particularly important, sketch out each for Milestone 2.  In later milestones,
all top-level UIs will be fully explained.</em>

<p>
The <tt>File</tt> menu contains typical commands for manipulating data files
and performing other system-level functions.  '<tt>File New</tt>' opens a new
calendar in a new display window.  '<tt>File Open</tt>' opens an existing
calendar from a previously saved file, displaying in the current display window
or a new window as selected by the user.  '<tt>File Close</tt>' closes the
currently active calendar, offering to save if it has been modified since
opening.  (The currently active calendar is the one on which the user has most
recently performed a command.)  '<tt>File Close All</tt>' closes all open
calendars, offering to save any that have been modified.  '<tt>File Save</tt>'
saves the currently active calendar on the file from which it was opened, or on
a new file if it was created from a new display.  '<tt>File Save As</tt>'
allows the current calendar to be saved on a different file from which it was
opened or most recently saved upon.  '<tt>File Save All</tt>' saves all
currently open calendars.  '<tt>File Print</tt>' prints the contents of the
currently active display window in a form suitable for output to a printing
device capable of displaying text and graphics.  '<tt>File Exit</tt>' exits the
Calendar tool.
<p>
The <tt>Edit</tt> menu contains commands for manipulating calendar data during
editing.  '<tt>Edit Undo</tt>' undoes the most recently completed editing
commands.  Repeated successive invocations of '<tt>Undo</tt>' will undo
successively earlier commands.  '<tt>Edit Redo</tt>' redoes the most recently
undone commands.  Repeated successive invocations of '<tt>Redo</tt>' will redo
the series of undone commands in reverse order.  '<tt>Edit Repeat</tt>'
displays a dialog that allows the most recently invoked command to be repeated
one or more times.  '<tt>Edit Cut</tt>' removes and copies the currently
selected datum in the current display.  '<tt>Edit Copy</tt>' copies the
currently selected datum without removing it. '<tt>Edit Paste</tt>' inserts the
most recently cut or copied datum at the currently selected edit point in the
current display.  '<tt>Edit Delete</tt>' removes the currently selected datum
without copying it.  '<tt>Edit Select All</tt>' selects all editable data in
the current display.  '<tt>Edit Find</tt>' performs a search for a given text
string.  The search is performed in all open calendars; successive invocations
of search with an unchanged search string searches for further occurrences of
the string until all occurrences are found.  '<tt>Edit Command</tt>' allows the
user to enter any Calendar tool command in textual form, including sequences of
commands to form scripts.

<em>Editorial Remark: The preceding descriptions of File and Edit operations
are typical for the kinds of tools we are working on in 308.  Your requirements
for these operations will likely be very similar to these.  Summary
descriptions need to be added for all of the other items on each of the
remaining menus.  The descriptions are organized into one paragraph per menu or
menu section, where a menu section is a set of items delineated by horizontal
rules in the menu.  These descriptions will be expanded and refined in near-
term future milestones.  The top-level command structure should be pretty well
stabilized by around Milestone 5, though minor updates can continue throughout
the quarter.</em>
