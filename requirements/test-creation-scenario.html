      <p>
         This introductory scenario shows a user creating a simple test. Test creation is one of the most fundamental and commonly performed with the Test Tool. In this scenario we will assume the User is registered with the application and just logged in to it. From here the User will select the "Tests" button as seen on the landing page in Figure 1.

      <p>
         Here the user will be presented with the Test Overview screen. Seen in Figure 2.

      <p>
         The Figure shows the highest level page involving test editing and creation. On the top menu bar the user is presented with a 'Create Test' button to create new tests, and a search bar to find already created tests.
      </p>

      <p>
         Each already created test is shown on the screen to the user. Relevant information about each test is shown including: The name of the test, its status (which indicates if the user has finished creating the test), and a red or green square indicating if the test is public or not. Red indicates the test is not public, while green indicates that the test is public.
      </p>

      <p>
         Finally at the bottom of the screen the user is presented with a page navigation bar so that they can move through their various created tests.
      </p>

      <p>
         To create a test the user will select the 'Create Test' button on the top menu bar, which will take them to the test creation page shown in Figure 3.
      </p>

      <p>
         This Figure has various data fields avaialable to the user. The first is a text field to name the test. The second and third will bring up a dialogue for the user to select a date that the test is intended to be taken on, seen in Figure 4.

      <p>
      This figure is simply a calendar which will auto-fill the data field it was brought up from when a time and date are selected
      </p>

      <p>
         Next, selecting the "Assign To" field will produce a drop down menu that allows the instructor to pick which classes this test should be associated with. This menu is shown in Figure 5.
      </p>

      <p>
         Finally the user will select from a few options involving test visibility, such as when to show exam scores to students or if they should be able to see their exams after finishing them. These can be seen in Figure 1.
      </p>

      <p>
         After this the user clicks the "Create Test and Add Questions" button and the automated test creator will populate the test with questions and allow the user to edit the newly created test if they wish.
