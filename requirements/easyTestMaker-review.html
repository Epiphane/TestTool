<p>
Easy Test Maker is a test-creation product that allows teachers to create tests with short answer, multiple choice, true/false, matching, and fill in the blank questions. The free version allows you to export your test to PDF and print, a $44.95/year license allows test questions and answers to be randomized, and a $74.95/year license also provides online test taking with automatic grading.

Overall, the product was not too difficult to use, but because I only had access to a free license I could not explore many of the features.
