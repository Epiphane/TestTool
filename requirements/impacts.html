1.4.  Impacts
</h3>

<p>
The potential positive impacts of the Testing Tool as a system are decreased test creation time, decreased test grading time, and increased ease of test administering. An inherent result of these positive impacts is a decrease in the time between test taking and receiving results back. This gives the student more immediate feedback when the test is still in recent memory, allowing them to more accurately assess their errors.

<p>
Potential negative impacts mainly stem from poor UI implementation. If the UI is difficult to understand or poorly laid out, it can lead to an increase in test creation and test grading time not a decrease, and could make administering the test no easier than traditional methods. Security flaws could be a potential negative impact as well. If the security is weak and a student or unauthorized user was able to gain access to exam scores, this would nullify all potential positive impacts as the system could not be trusted.
