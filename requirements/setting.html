1.3.  Operational Setting
</h3>
</a>

There are three operational settings for the Test Tool:
<ol>
<li>Use in proctored, in-class exams for testing by students</li>
<li>Use as a take-home test distribution software</li>
<li>Practice test taking by students</li>
</ol>

<p>
The Test Tool is intended to be public domain software, primarily as a tool for the Computer Science department and faculty. However, there is no specific operational setting we will require to be in place prior to the software. However, it is best suited to in-class or office use by a professor, where test-taking will be common, and the ability to view or manipulate proctored computers is a helpful feature.
</p>

<p>
The primary customer for the Test Tool is a representative of customers in the university department. As a result, the requirements of this tool reflect the customer's view, and subsequently operational setting. However, the tool will aim to exclude setting-specific features. It does not depend on any existing system, and manages its own state completely independently.
