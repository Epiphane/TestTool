      <p>
      This scenario illustrates when an instructor grades a student's test. After a test has been created and taken by students, the instructor then grades the test. When an instructor selects grade from the Test Overview page, the instructor is shown the screen shown in Figure 1, showing the tests completed by students.

      <p>
         This screen shows the list of completed tests available to grade for the selected test. Here the instructor can see which students have completed the test, and which students' tests they have graded or not graded. Clicking on one of the list items on this screen brings the user to the grading screen, seen in Figure 2.

      <p>
         This screen shows a sample screen an instructor might see when grading a test. Beacuse this question is multiple choice, it has been automatically graded by the TestTool, as indicated by the grayed out correct and incorrect check boxes. The instructor may use the comment box below the question and answer to leave feedback for the student. The Finish Test button in the top right of the screen is used to complete grading of the test, and the question select dialogue is used to navigate between questions.
      </p>

      <p>
         Figure 3 below shows when the instructor uses the question select dialogue to move to a question that requires some instructor grading.

      <p>
         This screen shows a sample question an instructor might see when grading a test with a free response question. Here the question could not be completely graded by the automatic grader, so the instructor must assign a point value on their own, done through the points text box. Again the instructor can leave any feedback for the student in the comment box below the question an answer. 
      </p>

         Finally, when an instructor clicks the Finish Test Button, the TestTool will show the screen shown in Figure 4.

            </p>
         </div>
      </hr>

      <p>
         This screen is what the instructor seeswhen they wish to complete grading. The instructor is presented with a few pieces of information important to the test including:
            <ul>
               <li>Who'se test they are grading</li>
               <li>The student's score</li>
               <li>The maximum possible score</li>
               <li>The time it took for the student to complete the test</li>
               <li>The maximum allowed time</li>
            </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>
         The instructor is also given three buttons to choose from. The Back button brings the instructor back to the test to modify or complete grading, the Finish button saves all changes made to the test, and bring the instructor back to the list of taken tests, finally the cancel button deletes any changes made to the test.
      </p>

      <p>
         If the instructor clicks the cancel button, a dialogue is displayed warning them that they will lose all changes. This dialogue is shown in Figure 5.
      </p>

            </p>
         </div>
      </hr>

      <p>
         This dialogue warns the instructor that they will lose changes to the grade assigned to the student. If the instructor clicks the no option, they are taken back to the screen in Figure 4. If the instructor clicks the yes option, they are taken back to the list of tests in Figure 1.
