      The instructor decides to move this question from the class "CPE 307" to
      the class "CPE 308", so he/she clicks the drop down menu in the top left
      which says "CPE 307", leading to the visual presented in Figure 3, and
      clicks "CPE 308" from the dropdown.

      question table, and selects the checkbox next to the recently modified
      question. The instructor then clicks "Make Test", intending to create a
      new, one-question test. The instructor is presented with the screen shown
      in Figure 4, which prompts for test information.
