      </span>

      If the raw list of questions is too overwhelming, the instructor can
      click the "Question Search" button in the lower left to open the screen shown
      in Figure 2.

      Once in the search screen, the instructor can return to the table of
      questions by clicking the "Question Table" button in the lower left.
      The search question screen is organized into three tabs of increasing specificity.
      The screen is initially opened to the subjects tab, where the instructor
      can search or scroll for a subject. The screen also supports sorting the
      listed items by either item name, item creation date, or item
      modification date, as shown in Figure 3.

      Once the instructor clicks a subject,
      the test tab will be focused and tests belonging to the selected subject
      will be shown, and the subject name will be populated in the search bar.
      The instructor can also select the test tab manually, or clear out the
      search bar and click search to view all tests, as shown in Figure 4.

      Once again, the instructor can search or scroll for a test, and selecting
      a test will open the questions tab with the selected test name prefilled
      in the search bar, shown in Figure 5. Clearing the search bar and
      clicking search will remove the subject/test filter for the questions and
      will list all questions. The instructor once again can manually select
      the question tab to view all questions unfiltered.
